Our Brazilian Santos coffee is roasted a shade between Light and City Roast and is typified by a very mild body and low acidity. This is easily the “softest” coffee that we currently roast, and many customers are surprised by what a difference that makes in the cup. This is an excellent bean for those who enjoy milk and sugar in their coffee.
